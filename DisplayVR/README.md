Hello everyone, I want to share with you my android app, with it you can use raspberry
or any other computer with virtual reality glasses for your smartphone (if you are lucky).
To do this, you will need a cable with type-c otg, hdmi video capture, and a micro hdmi to hdmi cable.
I want to note that only the image is transmitted here, so you still need a mouse and keyboard to interact with the computer.
You may have a ping in the image transmission, so I recommend setting it to 1280x720(look at it and tap the screen) 
and experiment with the resolution in the raspberry config file.
